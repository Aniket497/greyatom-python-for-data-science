### Project Overview

 Project on Student Performance Management 


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I have used the basic fundamentals of  python programming such as: list , dictionary, arithmetic operations, string formating


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. First I taken two lists with names of students in it as class_1 and class_2
2. Then I have combined the both into new_class
3. Then I have used append( ) function to add a missing name at the end of the list
4. Then I have used remove( ) function to delete a name from the list
5. Then I have created a dictionary containing all the subject marks for one student
6. Then I have converted the dictionary into a list containing marks only using values( ) function
7. Then I have calculated the total marks scored by using sum( ) function and dividing the sum with total marks I have calculated the percentage
8. Then I have created a dictionary containing all the marks of students in mathematics
9. Then I have used max( ) function to find out the student having maximum marks 
10. Then I have used split( ) function so that I can use the students last name-first and then first name
11. Then I have  used upper( ) fuction to make letters of name uppercase 


### Challenges faced

 When I was converting the dictionary to values for calculating the total marks I took help of GreyAtom tutorials 


### Additional pointers
